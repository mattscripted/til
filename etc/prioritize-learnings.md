# How to prioritize your learnings

In _The Clean Coder_, Robert C. Martin emphasizes that we are responsible for our careers. We must _practice_ outside of work, so we can _perform_ at work. It is our responsibility to learn new skills to further our careers.

Taking his lessons to heart, I use a skills matrix to guide my learnings, so I can level up from where I am today to where I want to be tomorrow.

## First, create a skills matrix

Create a skills matrix spreadsheet with at least the following columns:

- **Skill**: The name of the skill
- **Importance**: How necessary the skills is to your current and future positions
- **Current Level**: Where your ability currently stands

## Second, identify skills

Review job posting, developer profiles, blog posts, and anywhere else skills may be listed for both your current and desired positions.

## Third, identify skill importance

Research each skill to identify how important it is to your current and future positions.

| Importance | Definition |
| - | - |
| Low | I won't use this skill often, if at all |
| Medium | I think this skill is good to know |
| High | I will use this skill regularly |

## Fourth, identify your current skill levels

Reflect on each skill to identify your current skill level.

| Current Level | Definition |
| - | - |
| Zero | I don't know this skill at all |
| Low | I have a high-level understanding of this skill, and could struggle through it |
| Medium | I can use this skill regularly |
| High | I can use this skill with confidence |

## Fifth, prioritize skills to learn

Review each skill, considering its importance and your current level.

- Where are the largest skill gaps?
- Which skills are easier to learn?
- Which skills will help you learn other skills?

Prioritize each skill by its ROI (return on investment), and highlight it:

| Colour | Meaning |
| - | - |
| Red | High priority, very important to learn, will have a large impact |
| Yellow | Medium priority, would be nice to learn, will have an impact |
| Neutral | Low priority, not too important to learn for a while, will have some impact |
| Green | Very low priority, already really great at it, very little impact |

## Sixth, learn the highest priority skill

With your list of skills prioritized, pick the most important skill, and learn it.

1. Find tutorials, books, or courses
2. Pick a time to learn consistently, such as every morning before work for 30 minutes, or every Saturday for 2 - 4 hours.
3. Apply those skills on side projects or at work

## Seventh, keep on learning

Once you level up a skill, update your skills matrix. If you are satisfied with that skill, pick up the next priority skill, learn it, and repeat.
