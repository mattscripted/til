# Google's Speed of Code Reviews

Google's Engineering Practices recommend "we optimize for the speed at which a team of developers can produce a product together" by [reviewing code quickly](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/speed.html).

##  Respond quickly

The sooner and the more frequent we review code the better.

Before we start focused work, we should review code. After we finish focused work, we should review code. 

## Approve conditionally

Reduce delays by approving conditionally. Simply say, "Once you finish X, this is good to go!"
