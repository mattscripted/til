# Scope Creep

Often, we start tasks that seem small. Then, they grow and grow into more and more changes, spanning more and more days of work.

We believe that if we just push through this task, then we will do better next time. This task was just an outlier, of course. We will definintely do better next time, for sure.

Personally, I find scope creep occurs when:

- We have an unclear outcome
- We have not investigated enough before starting
- We have not broken down a task into sub-tasks
- We feel pressured to deliver quickly
- We break our processes

So, we keep going, and going, and going, with the hope that we will soon be done.

But, there's always one more thing. Until we're forced to wrap it up.

And, that sucks. We feel slow. We feel incomplete. We feel behind on what's next.

So, the cycle repeats.

## Stop. Catch your breath.

Imagine someone just came to you, and said:

> Hey, we want to complete this work, and it's falling behind schedule. What should we do?

For a moment, it does not matter how we got here. What matters is how we proceed from here. **This is a new problem.**

We start again:

- We set a clear outcome
- We clarify any unknowns
- We break the remaining work into sub-tasks
- We scope down or ask for more time
- We follow through

We get it done.

And then, we learn from this situation, and apply our learnings to next time. We improve.
