# Why use GraphQL?

GraphQL solves the problems of underfetching and overfetching.

Underfetching occurs when we call an API, but do not receive enough data, so we need to call another API to get the rest.

Overfetching occurs when we call an API, but receive too much data.

With GraphQL, we say exactly what we need, and we get exactly what we need. No more, no less.
