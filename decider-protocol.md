# Decider Protocol

The [Decider Protocol](https://www.darkcoding.net/behaviour/decider-protocol/) enables teams to make decisions quickly.

1. Someone proposes an idea
2. They count down, _3-2-1_
3. Everyone votes Yes (thumbs up), Support It (thumb neutral), or No (thumbs down)
4. If anyone votes No, the proposer asks what it will take to change their mind
5. A new idea is proposed, and the process repeats
6. If the proposal can be agreed upon, it is accepted
7. If the proposal cannot be agreed upon, it is rejected
