# Tech Lead Cheat Sheet

_You are much more than the code you write._

## Congratulations, you're now a Tech Lead!

- Welcome to the world of ambiguity, uncertainty, and responsibility
- Get comfortable working in a less quantifable world
- Shift your thinking from "How fast did I move?" to "How fast did the team move?"

## What are you afraid of?

- Leading is hard
- Delegating
- Talking to non-developers
- Having hard conversations
- Working too much

## What does a Tech Lead do?

As a Tech Lead, your success is not in the code you write, but in the solution the team produces as a whole. Your job is to support the team from a technical perspective.

- Set a technical vision
- Identify and resolve barriers
- Monitor progress
- Lead the team to achieve the vision

## Set a technical vision

The technical vision is the big lofty goal, like "build high-quality software." To achieve our technical vision, we continue to solve problems.

### Interview stakeholders

Start by talking to people who care about a problem.

- Create a list of questions, e.g.
  - What's going well?
  - What challenges are you having?
  - What is not being talked about?
  - Who else should I ask?
- Book one-on-one or group interviews
- Create a spreadsheet with:
  - One question per row
  - One individual or group per column
- Interview until you reach saturation: where the same things are being said over and over
- Discover insights
- Explore opportunities from insights

### Define the problem

Projects are scoped down work, such as "build a dashboard to monitor production health."

- Make sure you deeply understand the problem before jumping to solutions
- Align with your manager, higher-ups, and stakeholders on the problem you want to solve
- Always focus on what you want to achieve: the outcomes, end results, and must haves

### Define outcomes

- How can you measure the success of your work?
- Be objective, not subjective

### Propose a solution

- Provide clarity amongst the confusion and ambiguity
- Create small goals
- Create a timeline of milestones for accountability
- If something is unclear, seek facts not assumptions

## Identify and resolve barriers

- Check in at standup
- Check in with people one-on-one
- Have your own list of questions when talking to people
  - What's going well?
  - What challenges are you having?
  - Is there anything you would like to talk about?

## Monitor progress

- What are your metrics of success?
- How will you measure those metrics?
- Always focus on what you want to achieve, and what is the end result

## Lead the team to achieve the vision

- Build trust with the team: "People first, then results"

### Communicate

- Communicate early and often
- You are much less likely to go wrong by over-communicating and being transparent
- But, you are likely to go wrong by communicating late or not enough
- The more you communicate, the easier it will become
- Double-check with people
- Ask for feedback, if you're unsure about your communication style
- Communicate larger projects by creating a Slack channel with a fun project name
- Give people the space to provide feedback, questions, or concerns. Remind them that there is space for their voice to be heard.

### Delegate

- Give away as much of your work as possible, so you can use your time effectively
- Encourage people to want to do tasks, by showing what's in it for them

## Redefine your success

- As a developer, success can be measured in completing tasks with high quality
- Broaden your impact
- Teach others to do what you're good at doing
- Solve the bigger problems for your team

## Keep up with technology

- There is too much technology to know a lot about everything
- Instead, learn a little about a lot of things, so you can talk to others about those things

## Manage your time

- Don't assume all responsibilities
- Delegate to others to free up your time to do more impactful work
- Use a system to keep track of things, so you can purposely forget things. Trust your system.
- Don't record notes on paper, and then transfer them somewhere else. Write the notes immediately (or as close to) where you're going to need them.
- Improve your context switching skills
- Make a decision, and follow through. Don't second guess yourself and waffle about.
