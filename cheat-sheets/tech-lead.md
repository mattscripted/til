# Tech Lead Cheat Sheet

_You are much more than the code you write._

## Becoming a Tech Lead

- Congratulations, your work is now ambiguous!
- Get comfortable working in a less quantifable world
- Shift your thinking from "How fast did I move?" to "How fast did the team move?"

## What does a Tech Lead do?

As a Tech Lead, your success is not necessarily in the code you write, but in the solution the team produces as a whole. Your job is to support the team from a technical perspective.

- Set a technical vision
- Identify and resolve barriers
- Monitor progress
- Lead the team to achieve the vision

### Set a technical vision

- Start by talking to people who care about a problem
- Align with your manager, higher-ups, and stakeholders on the problem you want to solve
- If something is unclear, seek facts not assumptions
- Make sure you deeply understand the problem before jumping to solutions
- Focus on outcomes, not process

### Identify and resolve barriers

- Check in at standup
- Check in with people one-on-one

### Monitor Progress

- What are your metrics of success?
- How will you measure those metrics?

### Lead the team to achieve the vision

- Build trust with the team: "People first, then results"
