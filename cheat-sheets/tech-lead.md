# Tech Lead Cheat Sheet

_You are much more than the code you write._

## Congratulations, you're now a Tech Lead!

- Welcome to the world of ambiguity, uncertainty, and responsibility
- Get comfortable working in a less quantifable world
- Shift your thinking from "How fast did I move?" to "How fast did the team move?"

## What are you afraid of?

- Leading is hard
- Delegating
- Talking to non-developers
- Having hard conversations
- Working too much
- Coding less
- Feeling confused or unsure what to do next
- Assuming more responsibility

## Okay, what's good about being a Tech Lead, though?

- Deciding which problems to solve
- Solving bigger, often higher-level problems
- Enabling others to succeed
- Mentoring other developers
- Understanding how your work affects the team, the department, and the business
- Improving non-technical skills to deliver better technical solutions

## What does a Tech Lead do?

As a Tech Lead, your success is not in the code you write, but in the solution the team produces as a whole. Your job is to support the team from a technical perspective.

- Set a technical vision
- Identify and resolve barriers
- Monitor progress
- Lead the team to achieve the vision

If you're confused, then the team is confused. Often, your job is to be confused for the team, get over that confusion for yourself, and then remove that confusion for the team.

### Set a technical vision

The technical vision is the big lofty goal, like "build high-quality software." To achieve our technical vision, we continue to solve problems.

#### Interview stakeholders

Start by talking to people who care about a problem.

- Create a list of questions, e.g.
  - What's going well?
  - What challenges are you having?
  - What is not being talked about?
  - Who else should I ask?
- Book one-on-one or group interviews
- Create a spreadsheet with:
  - One question per row
  - One individual or group per column
- Interview until you reach saturation: where the same things are being said over and over
- Discover insights
- Explore opportunities from insights

#### Define the problem

Projects are scoped down work, such as "build a dashboard to monitor production health."

- Make sure you deeply understand the problem before jumping to solutions
- Align with your manager, higher-ups, and stakeholders on the problem you want to solve
- Always focus on what you want to achieve: the outcomes, end results, and must haves

#### Define outcomes

- How can you measure the success of your work?
- Be objective, not subjective

#### Propose a solution

- Provide clarity amongst the confusion and ambiguity
- Create small goals
- Create a timeline of milestones for accountability
- If something is unclear, seek facts not assumptions
- Stop investigating once you hit diminishing returns
- You don't need all the answers up front
- Communicate the problem and solution, so the team can get involved

### Identify and resolve barriers

- Check in at standup
- Check in with people one-on-one
- Have your own list of questions when talking to people
  - What's going well?
  - What challenges are you having?
  - Is there anything you would like to talk about?

### Monitor progress

- What are your metrics of success?
- How will you measure those metrics?
- Always focus on what you want to achieve, and what is the end result

### Lead the team to achieve the vision

- Build trust with the team: "People first, then results"

## Redefine your success

As a developer, success can be measured in completing tasks with high quality. As a Tech Lead, your success changes to how well the team solves problems.

- Broaden your impact
- Teach others to do what you're good at doing
- Solve the bigger problems for your team

## Build relationships

It is much easier to do your job as a Tech Lead when you have strong relationships across the team, the department, and the business. Take the time to naturally grow relationships, and they will pay dividends time and time again.

## Communicate

- Communicate early and often
- You are much less likely to go wrong by over-communicating and being transparent
- But, you are likely to go wrong by communicating late or not enough
- The more you communicate, the easier it will become
- Double-check with people
- Ask for feedback, if you're unsure about your communication style
- Communicate larger projects by creating a Slack channel with a fun project name
- Give people the space to provide feedback, questions, or concerns. Remind them that there is space for their voice to be heard.

It can be socially exhausting to be in plenty of conversations. Know your limit and block out "solo work time" so you can work effectively.

## Delegate

- Give away as much of your work as possible, so you can use your time effectively
- Encourage people to want to do tasks, by showing what's in it for them

## Manage your time

It's important to work sustainably, so you can best support for the team in the long-term. Keep your hours reasonable, so you can stick through the journey.

- Don't assume all responsibilities
- Delegate to others to free up your time to do more impactful work
- Use a system to keep track of things, so you can purposely forget things. Trust your system.
- Don't record notes on paper, and then transfer them somewhere else. Write the notes immediately (or as close to) where you're going to need them.
- Improve your context switching skills
- Make a decision, and follow through. Don't second guess yourself and waffle about.

## Keep up with technology

- There is too much technology to know a lot about everything
- Instead, learn a little about a lot of things, so you can talk to others about those things
- Balance breadth vs depth of skills
