# Define "what" outcomes, not "how" outcomes

Projects need clear outcomes, so we can move them to "done".

Without clear outcomes, projects will go on and on. Great work will fail, because we did not meet our definition of success.

Once we know the _why_ of a project, clearly define the _what_, and then be flexible on the _how_. With a clear _what_, we know what success looks like, but with a clear _how_, we will fail the moment we change our approach.

When definining projects, define outcomes by _what_ you do, not _how_ you do it.

## An example

A development team wants to improve the reliability of its CI/CD workflows. When our CI/CD workflows are unreliable, developers waste time trying to CI/CD problems instead of delivering features.

We suspect end-to-end tests are the main problem, so we might propose removing flaky end-to-end tests. This is a _how_ outcome. If we change our approach in any way, we will fail our project, because we did not satisfy our _how_ outcome - even if we still improved the reliability of our CI/CD workflows.

Instead, we might propose that we achieve a success rate of 80%. This is a _what_ outcome. It is a clear measure of success. If we improve the reliability of our CI/CD workflows, we can achieve this outcome.

When defining the success of a project, set _what_ outcomes, not _how_ outcomes.
