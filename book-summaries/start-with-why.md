# Why, How, and What

In _Start with Why_ by Simon Sinek, we learn of the golden circle comprising of _Why_, _How_, and _What_.

- At the center, we have _Why_. This is your purpose; why you do what you do.
- Surrounding _Why_, we have _How_. This is your process; how you do what you do.
- Surrounding _How_, we have _What_. This is your result; what you do.

Simon Sinek encourages us to _start with why_, and work outward. When we focus on _why_, we solve meaningful problems, not just any problem.
