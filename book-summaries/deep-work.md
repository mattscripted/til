# Deep Work

_Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World_ by Cal Newport discusses how to work productively without distraction, so we can make the most of our limited time.

## Key Takeaways

- Deep work is meaningful; shallow work is trivial
- To work deeply, you must "focus intently without distraction"
- Deep work takes practice, just like any other skill
- When you loop over finished work, redirect your focus to the next task

_"The most dangerous word in one's productivity vocabulary [is] 'yes." - Cal Newport_

## Roosevelt Dashes

[Roosevelt Dashes](https://minafi.com/build-focus-roosevelt-dashes) provide a technique for practicing deep work, where you work intently to finish something in an aggressive time.

- Pick a specific, clearly defined task
- Estimate how long it will take to finish
- Set an aggressive goal of finishing that task quickly
- Set a timer
- Focus hard to finish the task
- Compare how long it actually took to finish

These are intense practice sessions, so build the practice slowly.

## Daily Shutdown

Set a time to finish work everyday. Then, to truly have downtime, build a habit of formally shutting down at the end of your workday:

- Check emails, messages, and Pull Requests
- Review upcoming meetings, tasks, and deadlines
- Make a rough plan for the next day
- Announce that you are done for the day

_"When you work, work hard. When you're done, be done." - Cal Newport_

## Decide how to enjoy your leisure time

While it may seem like work to plan out your leisure time, making plans enables you to use your time on what you actually enjoy. Otherwise, you will waste your time on distractions that first catch your attention.

Schedule activities you want to do. Give every minute a purpose.
